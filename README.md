The workflow folder contains three scripts, two of which are python and run the majority of the code needed to analyze the data.
One script gets all the data from the pdf and creates a JSON file, the other creates PNG files of the graphs.
The third script is a jupyter notebook which runs and initiates the other scripts.
The PDF extractor outside of the folder isn't needed and is there only to further edit for other use cases.
